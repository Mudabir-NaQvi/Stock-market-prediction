## Project description
As a recent computer science graduate, I am thrilled to have worked on a stock market prediction project during my studies. This project involved creating an AI-based website that predicts the future performance of thirty selected companies in the Pakistan Stock Market. The project presented a unique challenge of dealing with large amounts of financial data and implementing effective machine learning models to make accurate predictions. I rose to the challenge by developing a custom dataset that was updated regularly and utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to train the models.
The website provides two prediction modules for short-term and long-term predictions and allows users to explore historical data and future predictions. The monthly growth of each company was displayed on the website, and the predictions were made for all four variables: high, low, open, and close. The user-friendly interface made it possible for the website to provide valuable insights into the stock market trends.
I had the opportunity to develop my skills in multiple areas, including data analysis, programming languages, and AI technologies. The use of Django and React frameworks helped to build a robust and scalable web application that was able to handle large amounts of data and provide seamless navigation. This project was a great learning experience, and I am proud of the work I have done. I am confident that the skills I developed during this project will serve me well in future software development projects.
